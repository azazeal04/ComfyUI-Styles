# ComfyUI-Styles
I have created 8 specfic art style nodes to use in ComfyUI.

What is in the custom style nodes?
There is 8 custom nodes namely:
Aesthetic_Styler:
Has about 50 Aesthetic art styles.

Anime_Styler:
Has about 50 Anime art styles.

Fantasy_Styler:
Has about 50 Fantasy art styles.

Gothic_Styler:
Has just over 50 Gothic art styles.

Line_Art_Styler:
Has about 50 Line art styles.

Movie_Poster_Styler:
Has about 50 Movie Poster art styles.

Punk_Styler:
Has about 50 Punk art styles.

Travel_Poster_Styler:
Has about 50 Travel Poster art styles.

Installation:
Open the archive and copy each of the style folders, within the archive, directly into your custom_nodes folder.
After the folders are placed inside the custom_nodes folder of your ComfyUI, start up the ComfyUI server and the nodes will be installed.

How to use:
When you want to add the nodes to your workflow, right click inside the workspace, select add node and there you will find the nodes under Azazeal.
Alternatively you can load the workflow included in the workflow by dragging and dropping it into the workspace.
